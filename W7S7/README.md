## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
- Same method name with different parameters
- Compiler resolves method calls at compile time
- Parameter type, number, and order variations

### Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Subclass provides specific implementation of superclass method
- @Override annotation for clarity and error prevention
- Dynamic method dispatch at runtime

### Dynamic Method Dispatch
- JVM determines which method to call based on actual object type
- Reference type vs object type distinction
- Runtime method resolution

### Upcasting and Downcasting
- Safe implicit upcasting (subclass to superclass)
- Explicit downcasting (superclass to subclass)
- ClassCastException prevention techniques

### instanceof Operator
- Type checking before downcasting
- Safe polymorphic programming practices
- Runtime type identification
