# Week 7 Session 7 (W7S7) - Polymorphism in Java

## Overview
This session covers polymorphism concepts in Java, including method overloading (compile-time polymorphism), method overriding (runtime polymorphism), dynamic method dispatch, upcasting, downcasting, and safe type checking with instanceof operator.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Master method overloading and understand compile-time polymorphism
- Implement method overriding for runtime polymorphism
- Understand dynamic method dispatch and JVM method resolution
- Learn safe upcasting and downcasting techniques
- Use instanceof operator for safe type checking
- Apply polymorphism concepts in real-world scenarios

## 🎯 Practice Problems (6 Problems)

### Problem 1: Gaming Arena - Method Overloading
**File:** `practice/GameBattle.java`
- Implement multiple overloaded attack methods
- Understand compile-time polymorphism
- Handle different parameter combinations (damage, weapon, critical hits, team attacks)

### Problem 2: Social Media Platform - Method Overriding
**File:** `practice/SocialMediaDemo.java`
- Override share() method in different social media platforms
- Demonstrate runtime polymorphism with @Override annotation
- Work with Instagram and Twitter post variations

### Problem 3: Food Delivery App - Dynamic Method Dispatch
**File:** `practice/FoodDelivery.java`
- Explore JVM method resolution at runtime
- Implement restaurant hierarchy (Pizza, Sushi)
- Understand reference type vs object type behavior

### Problem 4: University System - Upcasting Adventures
**File:** `practice/UniversitySystem.java`
- Learn safe upcasting from subclass to superclass
- Access inherited members through superclass reference
- Understand compile-time method binding limitations

### Problem 5: Entertainment System - Mastering Downcasting
**File:** `practice/EntertainmentHub.java`
- Practice explicit downcasting to access subclass methods
- Work with Movie and Game entertainment types
- Handle ClassCastException risks

### Problem 6: Smart Home - Safe Downcasting with instanceof
**File:** `practice/SmartHome.java`
- Use instanceof operator for safe type checking
- Prevent runtime exceptions through proper validation
- Implement flexible polymorphic smart device control

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
- Same method name with different parameters
- Compiler resolves method calls at compile time
- Parameter type, number, and order variations

### Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Subclass provides specific implementation of superclass method
- @Override annotation for clarity and error prevention
- Dynamic method dispatch at runtime

### Dynamic Method Dispatch
- JVM determines which method to call based on actual object type
- Reference type vs object type distinction
- Runtime method resolution

### Upcasting and Downcasting
- Safe implicit upcasting (subclass to superclass)
- Explicit downcasting (superclass to subclass)
- ClassCastException prevention techniques

### instanceof Operator
- Type checking before downcasting
- Safe polymorphic programming practices
- Runtime type identification

## 💡 Tips for Success
- Start with simple implementations, then add creative touches
- Test different scenarios to see polymorphism in action
- Think about real-world applications of these concepts
- Debug creatively and experiment with different approaches
- Focus on understanding WHY the JVM behaves differently in each case
- Pay attention to compile-time vs runtime method resolution
