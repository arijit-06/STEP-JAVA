## 🎯 Completion Requirements

### To Complete This Session:
1. **Implement all 3 problems** (12 files total)
2. **Test each demo class** and verify correct output
3. **Understand UML concepts** behind each implementation
4. **Identify relationship types** in each problem

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All Java files compile without errors
- [ ] Demo classes produce expected output
- [ ] Proper implementation of UML relationships
- [ ] Understanding of composition vs association
- [ ] Clear grasp of object interactions

## 📈 Learning Milestones

### Beginner Level ✅
- [ ] Understand basic UML diagram types
- [ ] Implement simple class relationships
- [ ] Create objects with proper encapsulation

### Intermediate Level 🎯
- [ ] Distinguish composition from association
- [ ] Model runtime object states
- [ ] Implement method call sequences

### Advanced Level 🚀
- [ ] Design complex UML relationships
- [ ] Apply UML patterns in real systems
- [ ] Master object interaction modeling

## 🔍 Self-Assessment Questions

After completing each problem, ask yourself:

### Problem 1 (Class Diagram):
- [ ] Can I explain the difference between composition and association?
- [ ] Do I understand why Library "owns" Books but Member "uses" Books?
- [ ] Can I identify multiplicity in the relationships?

### Problem 2 (Object Diagram):
- [ ] Can I distinguish between class and object diagrams?
- [ ] Do I understand how objects have specific values at runtime?
- [ ] Can I trace object relationships in running code?

### Problem 3 (Sequence Diagram):
- [ ] Can I follow the method call sequence?
- [ ] Do I understand message flow between objects?
- [ ] Can I identify lifelines and activation boxes?
