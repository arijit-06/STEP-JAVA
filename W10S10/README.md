# W10S10 - UML Diagrams and Object-Oriented Design

## 📚 Session Overview
This session focuses on UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams and their implementation in Java. You'll learn to design and implement systems using Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand UML diagram types and their purposes
- Design Class Diagrams with proper relationships
- Create Object Diagrams showing runtime instances
- Model Sequence Diagrams for method interactions
- Implement UML designs in Java code
- Apply composition and association relationships

## 📋 Problems Overview

### Problem 1: Library Management System (Class Diagram)
**Focus:** Class relationships, Composition vs Association
- **Classes:** Library, Book, Member
- **Relationships:** Composition (Library-Book), Association (Member-Book)
- **Key Concepts:** Object ownership, multiplicity

### Problem 2: Online Shopping System (Object Diagram)
**Focus:** Runtime object instances and their links
- **Classes:** Customer, Order, Product
- **Concepts:** Object instances, attribute values, runtime relationships

### Problem 3: ATM Transaction System (Sequence Diagram)
**Focus:** Method call sequences and interactions
- **Classes:** Customer, ATM, BankAccount
- **Concepts:** Message flow, lifelines, method invocation order

## 🔧 Key UML Concepts

### Class Diagram Elements
- **Classes:** Rectangles with name, attributes, methods
- **Relationships:** Association, Composition, Inheritance
- **Visibility:** + (public), - (private), # (protected)
- **Multiplicity:** 1, *, 1..*, 0..1

### Object Diagram Elements
- **Objects:** Instances with actual values
- **Links:** Runtime connections between objects
- **Values:** Specific attribute values at runtime

### Sequence Diagram Elements
- **Lifelines:** Vertical lines representing objects
- **Messages:** Arrows showing method calls
- **Activation:** Rectangles showing method execution

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Study UML Basics:**
   - Understand different diagram types
   - Learn relationship symbols
   - Practice reading diagrams

2. **Implement Each Problem:**
   - Start with Problem 1 (Class Diagram)
   - Move to Problem 2 (Object Diagram)
   - Complete with Problem 3 (Sequence Diagram)

3. **Test Your Implementation:**
   - Run each demo class
   - Verify expected output
   - Understand object interactions

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### For Class Diagrams
- Focus on proper encapsulation (private fields)
- Implement composition correctly (ownership)
- Use association for borrowing/using relationships

### For Object Diagrams
- Create specific instances with real values
- Show actual runtime relationships
- Demonstrate object state at specific time

### For Sequence Diagrams
- Follow method call order precisely
- Handle return values appropriately
- Show interaction between objects clearly

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After completing this session, you should be able to:
- ✅ Design Class Diagrams with proper relationships
- ✅ Implement composition and association in Java
- ✅ Create Object Diagrams showing runtime state
- ✅ Model Sequence Diagrams for method interactions
- ✅ Translate UML designs into working Java code
- ✅ Understand object-oriented design principles

## 📈 Success Criteria

- All three problems implemented correctly
- Proper UML relationship implementation
- Clean, readable code structure
- Correct output from demo classes
- Understanding of UML concepts
