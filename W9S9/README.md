# W9S9 - Object Class Methods and Inner Classes

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Master Object class methods (toString, equals, hashCode, getClass, clone)
- Understand different types of inner classes
- Apply object modeling and comparison techniques
- Implement cloning strategies (shallow vs deep copy)

## 🎯 Session Focus
**Object Class Methods & Inner Classes** - Advanced Java concepts for robust object-oriented design

## 📁 Problem Structure

### 📝 Assignment Problems (7 files)
**Focus:** Object class methods and inner class implementations

1. **VehicleRental.java** - Object Modeling & toString() implementation
2. **EmployeeAuth.java** - equals(), ==, and hashCode() methods
3. **PaymentGateway.java** - getClass() method usage
4. **Registration.java** - clone(), Shallow vs Deep Copy
5. **HospitalManagement.java** - Member Inner Class
6. **AppConfigurator.java** - Static Nested Class
7. **NotificationService.java** - Anonymous Inner Class

## 🎓 Key Concepts Covered

### Object Class Methods
- **toString()** - String representation of objects
- **equals()** - Object equality comparison
- **hashCode()** - Hash code generation for collections
- **getClass()** - Runtime type information
- **clone()** - Object copying (shallow and deep)

### Inner Classes
- **Member Inner Class** - Access to outer class members
- **Static Nested Class** - Independent of outer class instance
- **Local Inner Class** - Defined within methods
- **Anonymous Inner Class** - Inline class implementations

## 💡 Learning Progression

```
Object Methods → Inner Classes → Advanced Applications
     ↓               ↓               ↓
Basic Object    → Class Design  → Real Systems
Comparison      → Encapsulation → Professional Code
```
