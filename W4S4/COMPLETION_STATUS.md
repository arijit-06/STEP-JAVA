## üéØ Learning Milestones

### Inheritance Fundamentals
- [ ] Understand `extends` keyword and IS-A relationships
- [ ] Implement basic single inheritance
- [ ] Access protected fields from subclasses
- [ ] Test inheritance with simple class hierarchies

### Constructor Chaining
- [ ] Master `super()` calls to parent constructors
- [ ] Implement `this()` calls within same class
- [ ] Trace constructor execution order
- [ ] Handle parameter passing through inheritance chain

### Method Overriding
- [ ] Use `@Override` annotation correctly
- [ ] Call parent methods with `super.method()`
- [ ] Implement polymorphic method resolution
- [ ] Understand final methods that cannot be overridden

### Access Modifiers in Inheritance
- [ ] Work with private fields requiring getter/setter access
- [ ] Utilize protected fields accessible to subclasses
- [ ] Inherit public methods in all subclasses
- [ ] Understand package-private access

### Advanced Inheritance Patterns
- [ ] Build multilevel inheritance chains (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
- [ ] Implement hierarchical inheritance (A ‚Üí B, A ‚Üí C, A ‚Üí D)
- [ ] Combine both patterns in complex systems
- [ ] Use polymorphic arrays effectively

### Polymorphism Applications
- [ ] Create parent references to child objects
- [ ] Implement runtime method resolution
- [ ] Use arrays of parent type with different subclasses
- [ ] Apply `instanceof` operator for type checking
