## 🎯 Learning Milestones

### Inheritance Fundamentals ✅
- [x] Understand `extends` keyword and IS-A relationships
- [x] Implement basic single inheritance
- [x] Access protected fields from subclasses
- [x] Test inheritance with simple class hierarchies

### Constructor Chaining ✅
- [x] Master `super()` calls to parent constructors
- [x] Implement `this()` calls within same class
- [x] Trace constructor execution order
- [x] Handle parameter passing through inheritance chain

### Method Overriding ✅
- [x] Use `@Override` annotation correctly
- [x] Call parent methods with `super.method()`
- [x] Implement polymorphic method resolution
- [x] Understand final methods that cannot be overridden

### Access Modifiers in Inheritance ✅
- [x] Work with private fields requiring getter/setter access
- [x] Utilize protected fields accessible to subclasses
- [x] Inherit public methods in all subclasses
- [x] Understand package-private access

### Advanced Inheritance Patterns ✅
- [x] Build multilevel inheritance chains (A → B → C)
- [x] Implement hierarchical inheritance (A → B, A → C, A → D)
- [x] Combine both patterns in complex systems
- [x] Use polymorphic arrays effectively

### Polymorphism Applications ✅
- [x] Create parent references to child objects
- [x] Implement runtime method resolution
- [x] Use arrays of parent type with different subclasses
- [x] Apply `instanceof` operator for type checking
