## 🎯 Key Algorithms & Techniques

### Linear Queue Implementation
- Array-based implementation
- Front and rear pointer management
- Enqueue and dequeue operations

### Circular Queue Logic
- Modular arithmetic: (rear + 1) % size
- Efficient space utilization
- Full and empty condition handling

### Queue Using Stacks
- Two-stack approach
- Transfer operations between stacks
- Maintaining FIFO order

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### Queue Operations
- Always check bounds before enqueue/dequeue
- Handle empty and full queue conditions
- Update front and rear pointers correctly

### Circular Queue
- Use modular arithmetic for wraparound
- Distinguish between full and empty states
- Maintain proper size tracking
