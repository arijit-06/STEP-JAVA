## 📝 Notes and Reminders

### Key Focus Areas:
1. **Performance Optimization:** Always consider StringBuilder for multiple string operations
2. **ASCII Mastery:** Understand character ranges and manipulation techniques
3. **Algorithm Design:** Implement efficient custom solutions when built-in methods aren't suitable
4. **Memory Awareness:** Be conscious of string immutability and memory usage patterns

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Using String concatenation in loops (performance issue)
- Ignoring case sensitivity in string comparisons
- Not handling null or empty string edge cases
- Forgetting ASCII range boundaries in character manipulation
- Not considering thread safety when choosing StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

### Study Tips:
- Practice with large datasets to understand performance differences
- Experiment with ASCII values to master character manipulation
- Compare custom implementations with built-in methods
- Focus on algorithm efficiency and code readability
- Test edge cases thoroughly
