## 🎯 Learning Milestones

### Advanced Inheritance Patterns
- [ ] Master multilevel inheritance (A → B → C)
- [ ] Implement hierarchical inheritance (A → B, A → C, A → D)
- [ ] Combine both patterns in complex systems
- [ ] Understand diamond problem and solutions

### Constructor Chaining Mastery
- [ ] Implement complex super() call patterns
- [ ] Use this() calls within inheritance hierarchies
- [ ] Handle parameter passing through multiple levels
- [ ] Understand constructor execution order in deep hierarchies

### Method Overriding Excellence
- [ ] Apply @Override annotation best practices
- [ ] Call parent methods with super.method()
- [ ] Distinguish method hiding vs method overriding
- [ ] Work with final methods and inheritance restrictions

### Polymorphism Applications
- [ ] Implement runtime method resolution in deep hierarchies
- [ ] Use arrays of base type with multiple subclass levels
- [ ] Apply instanceof operator with complex hierarchies
- [ ] Perform type casting and safe downcasting

### Design Principles
- [ ] Apply Liskov Substitution Principle
- [ ] Follow Open/Closed Principle in inheritance
- [ ] Make Composition vs Inheritance decisions
- [ ] Implement Interface segregation in class hierarchies
