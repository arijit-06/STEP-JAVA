## 🎓 Key Concepts Covered

### Abstract Classes
- Abstract method declarations
- Concrete method implementations
- Constructor usage in abstract classes
- Protected member access

### Interfaces
- Method declarations without implementation
- Multiple interface implementation
- Interface inheritance
- Default and static methods (Java 8+)

### Advanced Abstraction
- Combining abstract classes with interfaces
- Polymorphism through abstraction
- Real-world design patterns
- Method name conflict resolution

## 💡 Learning Progression

```
Abstract Classes → Interfaces → Combined Usage → Real Applications
     ↓               ↓              ↓               ↓
Basic Abstraction → Contracts → Design Patterns → System Architecture
```
