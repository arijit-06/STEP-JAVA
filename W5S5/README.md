## 💡 Tips for Success
- Understand the difference between static and instance members
- Use static methods for utility functions that don't need object state
- Implement singleton pattern carefully to avoid threading issues
- Test static methods thoroughly as they can't be easily mocked
- Follow naming conventions for static constants (ALL_CAPS)
- Avoid overusing static methods - maintain good OOP principles
